#How To Run

Start 7 console in Ubuntu
For each console run

    $source set_glib_env.sh

Then start the program by following order

@server console 1:

    $cd Troll/
    $./troll 8081

@server console 2:

    $cd server/
    $./tcpd server

@server console 3:

    $cd server/
    $./ftps 8000

@client console 1:

    $cd Troll/
    $./troll 8081

@client console 2:

    $cd client/
    $./tcpd client

@client console 3:

    $cd client/
    $./timer

@client console 4:

    $cd client/
    $./ftpc serverhost 8000 1.jpg

# DESCRIPTION

This is the Project1 for course CSE 5462 Network Programming

ftps will receive the file that ftpc sends

ftps will listen on local_port, receive multiple files until stop manually by ctrl-C.

ftpc will send local_file_to_transfer to remote_IP:remote_port. One file will be sent during each run with one connection.

Jacobson's algorithm is used to implement RTT and RTO with the timer process.

Checksum computation CRC32 is used to compute the checksum of all packets to check for garbling.

tcpd implements a wrap-around buffer and sends the buffer to ftps when a request is made and the buffer is full.

By default, the ftps must depend on a running tcpd deamon on its system and should be ran with troll simulator. The ftpc must depend on both running tcpd deamon and troll simulator.

timer will listen on a local port, and receive start and cancel timer commands from the client tcpd or a driver.

driver will send test commands to timer on a local port.

Also not that stdlinux does not have the updated glib library needed to run this code so it must be run on ubuntu.
glib is useful for hashtables and error control. Output can be toggled using: "$source set_glib_env.sh".


# FILES

ftpc.c
This is the source file for ftpc, which contains the logic to send one file to server.

ftps.c
This is the source file for ftps, which contains the server logic to receive files.

tcpd.c
This is the source file for tcp deamon, which receives signal of ftpc and ftps, and send data through troll.

tcpudp.h
This is the header file for tcp interface, which used by ftp client and ftp server.

tcpudp.c
This is the implementation of tcp interface. It sends and receive signal and data to tcp deamon process.

crc.c
This is the implementation of CRC32 algorithm.

Header.h
definitions

Global.c
initialize time for tcpd and timer proceses

Global.h
header file for the global time initializer

timer.c
This is the source file for timer process, which contains logic to make delta time nodes for a doubly linked list.

TimerRequest.c
This is the function tcpd calls to set or remove timer nodes from timer.c

TimerRequest.h
This is the header for TimerRequest, which is used by tcpd

driver.c
This is the source file for the driver process, which sends start and stop timer commands to the timer process.

# TEST
To run built-in test, simply compile all first with

    make

Then start the server deamon on server (beta) with

    make tsrvtcpd

And

    make tsrvftps

in a sperate session of server. This will start a server listen on port 8000. Next run

    make tclitcpd

on client to start deamon and run

    make ttroll
    >trace

to start the troll network simulator with trace log. Finally run

    make tcli1

This will send client/1.jpg to beta:8000, you will see 1.jpg in server directory.

To test manually, compile first with

    make

Then start server with

    cd server && ./tcpd server
    cd server && ./ftps local_port

To start client, run

    cd client && ./tcpd client
    cd Troll && ./troll 8081
    cd client && ./ftpc remote_IP remote_port local_file_to_transfer

The file will be sent to server directory.

To start timer, run

    cd client && ./timer

Then start the driver with

    cd client && ./driver

The driver will then send commands on a hard-coded local port.
